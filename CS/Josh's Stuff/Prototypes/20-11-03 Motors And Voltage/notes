Fighting itself both going away from robot

UPDATED:
No longer fighting itself, the GPIO pin for dir was just wrongly wired lol
Because i did [31, 33, 23, 21] instead of [31, 33, 21, 23] lmao
So to fix it you either change the code or the pins on the Jetson

TODO:
Update the GUI to reflect that
Also work on the fact counter clockwise != clockwise. So for left or right you swap the speed
Also I had swapped left vs right
