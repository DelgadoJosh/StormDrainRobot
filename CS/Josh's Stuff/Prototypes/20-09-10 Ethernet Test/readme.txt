Two small scripts that basically pings & receives

To use:
In testClient.py update ip_address's value to the computer's ip address

In one terminal:
  python testServer.py 

In another terminal: 
  python testClient.py 

  Now you can type things
  Once you press enter:
    It'll send it to the server 
    Then the server will send it back
  
  To exit the script, type "quit" into the client.
