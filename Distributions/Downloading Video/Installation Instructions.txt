First Time Installation:
1. Download & Run "MobaXterm_installer_20.6.msi"
2. Once it's running, in the top left, click the button that says "Session"
3. In the popup "Session Settings", select "SSH" (it should be the far left option)
4. Enter the Settings:
       Remote Host: 10.0.0.2
       Click the checkbox for "Specify Username"
       Username: teamblack
       Port: the default (22)
5. Press ok
6. Now you should be back on the main screen, and on the left you should see "10.0.0.2 (teamblack)" as an option, and a terminal on the right should open up saying "enter password"
7. Optionally resize the left column where "10.0.0.2 (teamblack)" to be larger (this is the section that has the file directory)
8. Now run steps 2+ in the "Normal Use" section


Normal Use:
1. Double click the "10.0.0.2 (teamblack)" on the left to open its terminal on the right
2. Click the right hand side to focus on the terminal.
3. Enter the password: "password"  (no caps)
       Note that unlike most password boxes, this one won't display dots for every letter, this is normal for the terminal for security reasons. Just type the password, then press enter.
4. Verify that on the left a directory system appears
5. Navigate to "Desktop/Videos" to get a directory of all the video folders.
6. Double click the directory of your pipe name
7. Each video's title will be the date and time
8. Right click and download a video to download it. This could take a few minutes depending on the size of the video
       You could just double click a video to view it, but it has to download the *entire* video to view it, so at that point it's better to just download & delete afterwards.
